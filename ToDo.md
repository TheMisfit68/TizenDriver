Make send command check the runstate and fire of the commandqueue (instead of have it running constantly in the background like it was a plc-Class).What happens if 2 commands fire of the same commandqueue??

only delete commands from the queue when they get succesfully executed => teuotthave the running queue retry until they do???
have the execution of command check reachability, connectionstate, pairingstate
